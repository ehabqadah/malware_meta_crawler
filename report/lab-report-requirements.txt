- final presentation not before mid May (KW 19)
- paper till like 10 May 2017

Lab Report:

	- Table of Contents

	- Introduction
		- Motivation of your topic
		- general setting: why are we doing all this "malware as a growing problem, we need good tools, better tools blabla"
		- brief overview of the report structure (this is like the "written ToC")

	- Related Work (from foundational stuff to more specific stuff)
		- so: Malware analysis (general introduction to what malware analysis is about (static analysis, dynamic analysis))
			  MASS
			- could also put it in a Foundations chapter
			- Visualization:	- ssdeep (paper is there, linked on the ssdeep project page or github of ssdeep) and fuzzy hashing in general
								- similarity analysis / clustering based on entropy / fuzzy hashing (find example close to my topic)
								- look for papers regarding malware visualization (visualization of malware data in general) -> which gain do i have, say that this is not only artificial, but also other ppl do it

	- Foundations
		- tools i am using
		- D3 (few lines is sufficient)
		- what have you used what is not written by yourself
			- just referencing D3 is ok 

	- Theoretical Project Description (rename :D)
		- your idea to solve the problem
		- formal / algorithmic description (i.e. work flow (diagram or whatever)), diagrams make it easier (so use one)

	- Implementation
		- how you realized the idea
		- NOT a code documentation (if something is short / elegant / remarkable , show code snippet, but otherwise don't)

	- Evaluation
		- every evaluation is useless if you don't say which important aspects you want to tackle
		- state your goal: what do you want to find out?
		- setup (how did you organize your stuff, blabla).. ppl ususally don't write enough for the setup (ist ihnen sehr wichtig) .. machine specification network used ... D3 v xyz also for js and jquery ... everything which could have an effect on our measurement 
		- metrics (how did you measure like the performance (memory usage, CPU usage, network consumption, time to run for some amount of data))
		- present data in a suitable form (visualization is key to show data in a good measure (like diagram is better to see than some tables))
		- conclude findings

	- Conclusion of the complete work / Outlook on some future work (or split outlook and future work)
		- personal judgement of your own work somewhere in there (like everything worked out as expected ... or not)
